# my-first-blog
The main website can be found http://thecolorfulguitar.pythonanywhere.com/.

Two applications comprise this website: 1. a blog and 2. a form to collect data 
([Add Results](http://thecolorfulguitar.pythonanywhere.com/add_results/)) that dynamically populate 
charts and tables in the [Statistics](http://thecolorfulguitar.pythonanywhere.com/statistics) page.

The purpose of this website is to provide a space to collect and visualize the data generated through 
playing endless hours of FIFA, a video game that my friends have been doing since college. 
We refer to this gathering as the "FIFA Lounge." 
Very likely, only a select crowd will find the content of this website even mildly 
interesting -- a crowd of approximately six people -- because, well, the group has personalized the FIFA Lounge in a specific way.
